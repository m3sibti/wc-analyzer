6/7/20, 6:11 PM - SubTain Malik: Acccording to some, for Pakistan peak is next two weeks.

Do not leave home to buy anything, because the worst time is starting from today .

It's going to happen ..... *"Incubation" from today*

The date will expire and many positive cases will come up. Most people are at risk of infection, so staying home is very important and necessary.

We must exercise maximum caution between this period. 
Because we will be on the topmost side of the virus, usually all the infections will appear in these two weeks, then the next two weeks will be quiet - hopefully And over the next two weeks, it will be down.

*The horrible thing that happened in Italy was that this contagious week was ignored there and so all the cases came up there together.*

*Don't visit anyone and don't meet anyone, don't even visit close family, this is for the benefit of all of you*.

*This time you will be at the maximum stage of transition*

Send this message to all your relatives and friends you care about as I did. 🙏🙏
